/**
 * AnimationBuilder is an injectable service that is available when the {\@link
 * BrowserAnimationsModule BrowserAnimationsModule} or {\@link NoopAnimationsModule
 * NoopAnimationsModule} modules are used within an application.
 *
 * The purpose if this service is to produce an animation sequence programmatically within an
 * angular component or directive.
 *
 * Programmatic animations are first built and then a player is created when the build animation is
 * attached to an element.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // remember to include the BrowserAnimationsModule module for this to work...
 * import {AnimationBuilder} from '\@angular/animations';
 *
 * class MyCmp {
 *   constructor(private _builder: AnimationBuilder) {}
 *
 *   makeAnimation(element: any) {
 *     // first build the animation
 *     const myAnimation = this._builder.build([
 *       style({ width: 0 }),
 *       animate(1000, style({ width: '100px' }))
 *     ]);
 *
 *     // then create a player from it
 *     const player = myAnimation.create(element);
 *
 *     player.play();
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When an animation is built an instance of {\@link AnimationFactory AnimationFactory} will be
 * returned. Using that an {\@link AnimationPlayer AnimationPlayer} can be created which can then be
 * used to start the animation.

/**
 * `trigger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the
 * {\@link Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better
 * understanding of how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `trigger` Creates an animation trigger which will a list of {\@link state state} and
 * {\@link transition transition} entries that will be evaluated when the expression
 * bound to the trigger changes.
 *
 * Triggers are registered within the component annotation data under the
 * {\@link Component#animations animations section}. An animation trigger can be placed on an element
 * within a template by referencing the name of the trigger followed by the expression value that
 * the
 * trigger is bound to (in the form of `[\@triggerName]="expression"`.
 *
 * Animation trigger bindings strigify values and then match the previous and current values against
 * any linked transitions. If a boolean value is provided into the trigger binding then it will both
 * be represented as `1` or `true` and `0` or `false` for a true and false boolean values
 * respectively.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `trigger` will create an animation trigger reference based on the provided `name` value. The
 * provided `animation` value is expected to be an array consisting of {\@link state state} and
 * {\@link transition transition} declarations.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *       state(...),
 *       state(...),
 *       transition(...),
 *       transition(...)
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   myStatusExp = "something";
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation
 * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->
 * <div [\@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Disable Animations
 * A special animation control binding called `\@.disabled` can be placed on an element which will
 * then disable animations for any inner animation triggers situated within the element as well as
 * any animations on the element itself.
 *
 * When true, the `\@.disabled` binding will prevent all animations from rendering. The example
 * below shows how to use this feature:
 *
 * ```ts
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   template: `
 *     <div [\@.disabled]="isDisabled">
 *       <div [\@childAnimation]="exp"></div>
 *     </div>
 *   `,
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger("childAnimation", [
 *       // ...
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   isDisabled = true;
 *   exp = '...';
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The `\@childAnimation` trigger will not animate because `\@.disabled` prevents it from happening
 * (when true).
 *
 * Note that `\@.disabled` will only disable all animations (this means any animations running on
 * the same element will also be disabled).
 *
 * ### Disabling Animations Application-wide
 * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled, **all** inner components will
 * also have their animations disabled as well. This means that all animations for an angular
 * application can be disabled by placing a host binding set on `\@.disabled` on the topmost Angular
 * component.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import {Component, HostBinding} from '\@angular/core';
 *
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'app-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',
 * })
 * class AppComponent {
 *   \@HostBinding('\@.disabled')
 *   public animationsDisabled = true;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### What about animations that us `query()` and `animateChild()`?
 * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can {\@link query query} for inner
 * elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate them as it sees fit. This is
 * also the case for when a sub animation is queried by a parent and then later animated using {\@link
 * animateChild animateChild}.
 *
 * \@experimental Animation support is experimental.

/**
 * `animate` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of
 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `animate` specifies an animation step that will apply the provided `styles` data for a given
 * amount of time based on the provided `timing` expression value. Calls to `animate` are expected
 * to be used within {\@link sequence an animation sequence}, {\@link group group}, or {\@link
 * transition transition}.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:
 *
 * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional delay
 * and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`
 * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,
 * delay=100, easing=ease-out`. If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the
 * `duration` value in millisecond form.
 * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {\@link style style} or {\@link
 * keyframes keyframes}. If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected
 * and used (this is useful when describing an animation step that will complete an animation by
 * {\@link transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // various functions for specifying timing data
 * animate(500, style(...))
 * animate("1s", style(...))
 * animate("100ms 0.5s", style(...))
 * animate("5s ease", style(...))
 * animate("5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)", style(...))
 *
 * // either style() of keyframes() can be used
 * animate(500, style({ background: "red" }))
 * animate(500, keyframes([
 *   style({ background: "blue" })),
 *   style({ background: "red" }))
 * ])

 *
 * `group` specifies a list of animation steps that are all run in parallel. Grouped animations are
 * useful when a series of styles must be animated/closed off at different starting/ending times.
 *
 * The `group` function can either be used within a {\@link sequence sequence} or a {\@link transition
 * transition} and it will only continue to the next instruction once all of the inner animation
 * steps have completed.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `steps` data that is passed into the `group` animation function can either consist of {\@link
 * style style} or {\@link animate animate} function calls. Each call to `style()` or `animate()`
 * within a group will be executed instantly (use {\@link keyframes keyframes} or a {\@link
 * animate#usage animate() with a delay value} to offset styles to be applied at a later time).
 *
 * ```typescript

 *
 * `sequence` Specifies a list of animation steps that are run one by one. (`sequence` is used by
 * default when an array is passed as animation data into {\@link transition transition}.)
 *
 * The `sequence` function can either be used within a {\@link group group} or a {\@link transition

 *
 * ### Usage
 *

 *
 * `style` declares a key/value object containing CSS properties/styles that can then be used for
 * {\@link state animation states}, within an {\@link sequence animation sequence}, or as styling data
 * for both {\@link animate animate} and {\@link keyframes keyframes}.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `style` takes in a key/value string map as data and expects one or more CSS property/value pairs
 * to be defined.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // string values are used for css properties
 * style({ background: "red", color: "blue" })
 *
 * // numerical (pixel) values are also supported

 * ```
 *
 * #### Auto-styles (using `*`)
 *
 * When an asterix (`*`) character is used as a value then it will be detected from the element
 * being animated and applied as animation data when the animation starts.
 *
 * This feature proves useful for a state depending on layout and/or environment factors; in such
 * cases the styles are calculated just before the animation starts.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // the steps below will animate from 0 to the
 * // actual height of the element
 * style({ height: 0 }),
 * animate("1s", style({ height: "*" }))
 * ```

 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of

 *
 * `state` declares an animation state within the given trigger. When a state is active within a
 * component then its associated styles will persist on the element that the trigger is attached to
 * (even when the animation ends).
 *
 * To animate between states, have a look at the animation {\@link transition transition} DSL
 * function. To register states to an animation trigger please have a look at the {\@link trigger
 * trigger} function.
 *
 * #### The `void` state
 *
 * The `void` state value is a reserved word that angular uses to determine when the element is not
 * apart of the application anymore (e.g. when an `ngIf` evaluates to false then the state of the
 * associated element is void).
 *
 * #### The `*` (default) state
 *
 * The `*` state (when styled) is a fallback state that will be used if the state that is being
 * animated is not declared within the trigger.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `state` will declare an animation state with its associated styles
 * within the given trigger.
 *
 * - `stateNameExpr` can be one or more state names separated by commas.
 * - `styles` refers to the {\@link style styling data} that will be persisted on the element once

 *
 * `keyframes` specifies a collection of {\@link style style} entries each optionally characterized
 * by an `offset` value.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `keyframes` animation function is designed to be used alongside the {\@link animate animate}
 * animation function. Instead of applying animations from where they are currently to their
 * destination, keyframes can describe how each style entry is applied and at what point within the
 * animation arc (much like CSS Keyframe Animations do).
 *
 * For each `style()` entry an `offset` value can be set. Doing so allows to specifiy at what
 * percentage of the animate time the styles will be applied.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // the provided offset values describe when each backgroundColor value is applied.
 * animate("5s", keyframes([
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "red", offset: 0 }),
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "blue", offset: 0.2 }),
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "orange", offset: 0.3 }),
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "black", offset: 1 })
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, if there are no `offset` values used within the style entries then the offsets
 * will be calculated automatically.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * animate("5s", keyframes([
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "red" }) // offset = 0
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "blue" }) // offset = 0.33
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "orange" }) // offset = 0.66
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "black" }) // offset = 1
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * {\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}

/**
 * `transition` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of
 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `transition` declares the {\@link sequence sequence of animation steps} that will be run when the
 * provided `stateChangeExpr` value is satisfied. The `stateChangeExpr` consists of a `state1 =>
 * state2` which consists of two known states (use an asterix (`*`) to refer to a dynamic starting
 * and/or ending state).
 *
 * A function can also be provided as the `stateChangeExpr` argument for a transition and this
 * function will be executed each time a state change occurs. If the value returned within the
 * function is true then the associated animation will be run.
 *
 * Animation transitions are placed within an {\@link trigger animation trigger}. For an transition
 * to animate to a state value and persist its styles then one or more {\@link state animation
 * states} is expected to be defined.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * An animation transition is kicked off the `stateChangeExpr` predicate evaluates to true based on
 * what the previous state is and what the current state has become. In other words, if a transition
 * is defined that matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be
 * triggered.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger
 * trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the
 *   // animation has fully completed itself
 *   state("on", style({ background: "green" })),
 *   state("off", style({ background: "grey" })),
 *
 *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value
 *   // bound to "myAnimationTrigger" changes from "on" to "off"
 *   transition("on => off", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions
 *   transition("on <=> off", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas
 *   transition("on => off, off => void", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into
 *   // the page and the destination state is unknown
 *   transition("void => *", [
 *     style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *     animate(500)
 *   ]),
 *
 *   // this will capture a state change between any states
 *   transition("* => *", animate("1s 0s")),
 *
 *   // you can also go full out and include a function
 *   transition((fromState, toState) => {
 *     // when `true` then it will allow the animation below to be invoked
 *     return fromState == "off" && toState == "on";
 *   }, animate("1s 0s"))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation
 * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->
 * <div [\@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * #### The final `animate` call
 *
 * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only** uses a
 * timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final animation arc
 * for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of
 * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the
 * applied state to be presented correctly.
 *
 * ```
 * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state
 * // is currently active for "myAnimationTrigger"
 * transition("void => *", [
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(500)
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using :enter and :leave
 *
 * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common, the `transition`
 * function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which are aliases for the `void => *` and `*
 * => void` state changes.
 *
 * ```
 * transition(":enter", [
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 * ]),
 * transition(":leave", [
 *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Boolean values
 * if a trigger binding value is a boolean value then it can be matched using a transition
 * expression that compares `true` and `false` or `1` and `0`.
 *
 * ```
 * // in the template
 * <div [\@openClose]="open ? true : false">...</div>
 *
 * // in the component metadata
 * trigger('openClose', [
 *   state('true', style({ height: '*' })),
 *   state('false', style({ height: '0px' })),
 *   transition('false <=> true', animate(500))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using :increment and :decrement
 * In addition to the :enter and :leave transition aliases, the :increment and :decrement aliases
 * can be used to kick off a transition when a numeric value has increased or decreased in value.
 *
 * ```
 * import {group, animate, query, transition, style, trigger} from '\@angular/animations';
 * import {Component} from '\@angular/core';
 *
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'banner-carousel-component',

 *
 * ```

/**
 * `animateChild` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. It works by allowing a queried element to execute its own
 * animation within the animation sequence.
 *
 * Each time an animation is triggered in angular, the parent animation
 * will always get priority and any child animations will be blocked. In order
 * for a child animation to run, the parent animation must query each of the elements
 * containing child animations and then allow the animations to run using `animateChild`.
 *
 * The example HTML code below shows both parent and child elements that have animation
 * triggers that will execute at the same time.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- parent-child.component.html -->
 * <button (click)="exp =! exp">Toggle</button>
 * <hr>
 *
 * <div [\@parentAnimation]="exp">
 *   <header>Hello</header>
 *   <div [\@childAnimation]="exp">
 *       one
 *   </div>
 *   <div [\@childAnimation]="exp">
 *       two
 *   </div>
 *   <div [\@childAnimation]="exp">
 *       three
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * Now when the `exp` value changes to true, only the `parentAnimation` animation will animate
 * because it has priority. However, using `query` and `animateChild` each of the inner animations
 * can also fire:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // parent-child.component.ts
 * import {trigger, transition, animate, style, query, animateChild} from '\@angular/animations';
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'parent-child-component',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger('parentAnimation', [
 *       transition('false => true', [
 *         query('header', [
 *           style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *           animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *         ]),
 *         query('\@childAnimation', [
 *           animateChild()
 *         ])
 *       ])
 *     ]),
 *     trigger('childAnimation', [
 *       transition('false => true', [
 *         style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *         animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *       ])
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class ParentChildCmp {
 *   exp: boolean = false;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * In the animation code above, when the `parentAnimation` transition kicks off it first queries to
 * find the header element and fades it in. It then finds each of the sub elements that contain the
 * `\@childAnimation` trigger and then allows for their animations to fire.
 *
 * This example can be further extended by using stagger:
 *
 * ```ts
 * query('\@childAnimation', stagger(100, [
 *   animateChild()
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * Now each of the sub animations start off with respect to the `100ms` staggering step.
 *
 * ## The first frame of child animations
 * When sub animations are executed using `animateChild` the animation engine will always apply the
 * first frame of every sub animation immediately at the start of the animation sequence. This way
 * the parent animation does not need to set any initial styling data on the sub elements before the
 * sub animations kick off.
 *
 * In the example above the first frame of the `childAnimation`'s `false => true` transition
 * consists of a style of `opacity: 0`. This is applied immediately when the `parentAnimation`
 * animation transition sequence starts. Only then when the `\@childAnimation` is queried and called
 * with `animateChild` will it then animate to its destination of `opacity: 1`.
 *
 * Note that this feature designed to be used alongside {\@link query query()} and it will only work
 * with animations that are assigned using the Angular animation DSL (this means that CSS keyframes
 * and transitions are not handled by this API).
 *

 * being animated within the sequence. The provided animation steps are applied
 * to the queried element (by default, an array is provided, then this will be
 * treated as an animation sequence).
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * query() is designed to collect mutiple elements and works internally by using
 * `element.querySelectorAll`. An additional options object can be provided which
 * can be used to limit the total amount of items to be collected.
 *
 * ```js
 * query('div', [
 *   animate(...),
 *   animate(...)
 * ], { limit: 1 })
 * ```
 *
 * query(), by default, will throw an error when zero items are found. If a query
 * has the `optional` flag set to true then this error will be ignored.
 *
 * ```js
 * query('.some-element-that-may-not-be-there', [
 *   animate(...),
 *   animate(...)
 * ], { optional: true })
 * ```
 *
 * ### Special Selector Values
 *
 * The selector value within a query can collect elements that contain angular-specific
 * characteristics
 * using special pseudo-selectors tokens.
 *
 * These include:
 *
 *  - Querying for newly inserted/removed elements using `query(":enter")`/`query(":leave")`
 *  - Querying all currently animating elements using `query(":animating")`
 *  - Querying elements that contain an animation trigger using `query("\@triggerName")`
 *  - Querying all elements that contain an animation triggers using `query("\@*")`
 *  - Including the current element into the animation sequence using `query(":self")`
 *
 *
 *  Each of these pseudo-selector tokens can be merged together into a combined query selector
 * string:
 *
 *  ```
 *  query(':self, .record:enter, .record:leave, \@subTrigger', [...])
 *  ```
 *
 * ### Demo
 *
 * ```
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'inner',
 *   template: `
 *     <div [\@queryAnimation]="exp">
 *       <h1>Title</h1>
 *       <div class="content">
 *         Blah blah blah
 *       </div>
 *     </div>
 *   `,

 *      transition('* => goAnimate', [
 *        // hide the inner elements
 *        query('h1', style({ opacity: 0 })),
 *        query('.content', style({ opacity: 0 })),
 *
 *        // animate the inner elements in, one by one
 *        query('h1', animate(1000, style({ opacity: 1 })),
 *        query('.content', animate(1000, style({ opacity: 1 })),
 *      ])
 *    ])
 *  ]
 * })

/**
 * `stagger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. It is designed to be used inside of an animation {\@link query query()}
 * and works by issuing a timing gap between after each queried item is animated.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * In the example below there is a container element that wraps a list of items stamped out
 * by an ngFor. The container element contains an animation trigger that will later be set
 * to query for each of the inner items.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- list.component.html -->
 * <button (click)="toggle()">Show / Hide Items</button>
 * <hr />
 * <div [\@listAnimation]="items.length">
 *   <div *ngFor="let item of items">
 *     {{ item }}
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * The component code for this looks as such:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import {trigger, transition, style, animate, query, stagger} from '\@angular/animations';
 * \@Component({
 *   templateUrl: 'list.component.html',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger('listAnimation', [
 *        //...
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class ListComponent {
 *   items = [];
 *
 *   showItems() {
 *     this.items = [0,1,2,3,4];
 *   }
 *
 *   hideItems() {
 *     this.items = [];
 *   }
 *
 *   toggle() {
 *     this.items.length ? this.hideItems() : this.showItems();
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * And now for the animation trigger code:
 *
 * ```ts
 * trigger('listAnimation', [
 *   transition('* => *', [ // each time the binding value changes
 *     query(':leave', [
 *       stagger(100, [
 *         animate('0.5s', style({ opacity: 0 }))
 *       ])
 *     ]),
 *     query(':enter', [
 *       style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *       stagger(100, [
 *         animate('0.5s', style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *       ])
 *     ])
 *   ])
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * Now each time the items are added/removed then either the opacity
 * fade-in animation will run or each removed item will be faded out.
 * When either of these animations occur then a stagger effect will be
 * applied after each item's animation is started.
 *
 * \@experimental Animation support is experimental.

 * Note: it's better to use {\@link Router#navigate} service to trigger route changes. Use

 *
 * `Location` is responsible for normalizing the URL against the application's base href.
 * A normalized URL is absolute from the URL host, includes the application's base href, and has no
 * trailing slash:
 * - `/my/app/user/123` is normalized
 * - `my/app/user/123` **is not** normalized

 * \@whatItDoes Use URL for storing application location data.
 * \@description
 * `PathLocationStrategy` is a {\@link LocationStrategy} used to configure the
 * {\@link Location} service to represent its state in the
 * [path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator#Syntax) of the
 * browser's URL.
 *
 * If you're using `PathLocationStrategy`, you must provide a {\@link APP_BASE_HREF}
 * or add a base element to the document. This URL prefix that will be preserved
 * when generating and recognizing URLs.
 *
 * For instance, if you provide an `APP_BASE_HREF` of `'/my/app'` and call
 * `location.go('/foo')`, the browser's URL will become
 * `example.com/my/app/foo`.
 *
 * Similarly, if you add `<base href='/my/app'/>` to the document and call
 * `location.go('/foo')`, the browser's URL will become
 * `example.com/my/app/foo`.

 * What you want to pay attention to are:
 * - possibly removing a space for languages that don't use it, such as many East Asian languages
 * - possibly adding a comma, other punctuation, or a combining word
 *
 * For example:
 * - English uses `{1} 'at' {0}` or `{1}, {0}` (depending on date style), while Japanese uses
 *  `{1}{0}`.
 * - An English formatted date-time using the combining pattern `{1}, {0}` could be
 *  `Dec 10, 2010, 3:59:49 PM`. Notice the comma and space between the date portion and the time
 *  portion.
 *
 * There are four formats (`full`, `long`, `medium`, `short`); the determination of which to use
 * is normally based on the date style. For example, if the date has a full month and weekday
 * name, the full combining pattern will be used to combine that with a time. If the date has
 * numeric month, the short version of the combining pattern will be used to combine that with a
 * time. English uses `{1} 'at' {0}` for full and long styles, and `{1}, {0}` for medium and short
 * styles.

/**
 * Number format that depends on the locale.
 *
 * Numbers are formatted using patterns, like `#,###.00`. For example, the pattern `#,###.00`
 * when used to format the number 12345.678 could result in "12'345,67". That would happen if the
 * grouping separator for your language is an apostrophe, and the decimal separator is a comma.
 *
 * <b>Important:</b> The characters `.` `,` `0` `#` (and others below) are special placeholders;
 * they stand for the decimal separator, and so on, and are NOT real characters.
 * You must NOT "translate" the placeholders; for example, don't change `.` to `,` even though in
 * your language the decimal point is written with a comma. The symbols should be replaced by the
 * local equivalents, using the Number Symbols for your language.
 *
 * Here are the special characters used in number patterns:
 *
 * | Symbol | Meaning |
 * |--------|---------|
 * | . | Replaced automatically by the character used for the decimal point. |
 * | , | Replaced by the "grouping" (thousands) separator. |
 * | 0 | Replaced by a digit (or zero if there aren't enough digits). |
 * | # | Replaced by a digit (or nothing if there aren't enough). |
 * | ¤ | This will be replaced by a currency symbol, such as $ or USD. |
 * | % | This marks a percent format. The % symbol may change position, but must be retained. |
 * | E | This marks a scientific format. The E symbol may change position, but must be retained. |
 * | ' | Special characters used as literal characters are quoted with ASCII single quotes. |

 *
 * `NgComponentOutlet` requires a component type, if a falsy value is set the view will clear and
 * any existing component will get destroyed.
 *
 * ### Fine tune control
 *
 * You can control the component creation process by using the following optional attributes:
 *
 * * `ngComponentOutletInjector`: Optional custom {\@link Injector} that will be used as parent for
 * the Component. Defaults to the injector of the current view container.
 *
 * * `ngComponentOutletContent`: Optional list of projectable nodes to insert into the content
 * section of the component, if exists.
 *
 * * `ngComponentOutletNgModuleFactory`: Optional module factory to allow dynamically loading other
 * module, then load a component from that module.
 *
 * ### Syntax
 *
 * Simple
 * ```
 * <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="componentTypeExpression"></ng-container>
 * ```
 *
 * Customized injector/content
 * ```
 * <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="componentTypeExpression;
 *                                   injector: injectorExpression;
 *                                   content: contentNodesExpression;">
 * </ng-container>
 * ```
 *
 * Customized ngModuleFactory
 * ```
 * <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="componentTypeExpression;
 *                                   ngModuleFactory: moduleFactory;">
 * </ng-container>
 * ```
 * ## Example
 *
 * {\@example common/ngComponentOutlet/ts/module.ts region='SimpleExample'}
 *
 * A more complete example with additional options:
 *
 * {\@example common/ngComponentOutlet/ts/module.ts region='CompleteExample'}

/**
 * The `NgForOf` directive instantiates a template once per item from an iterable. The context
 * for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable
 * set to the current item from the iterable.
 *
 * ### Local Variables
 *
 * `NgForOf` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:
 *
 * - `$implicit: T`: The value of the individual items in the iterable (`ngForOf`).
 * - `ngForOf: NgIterable<T>`: The value of the iterable expression. Useful when the expression is
 * more complex then a property access, for example when using the async pipe (`userStreams |
 * async`).
 * - `index: number`: The index of the current item in the iterable.
 * - `first: boolean`: True when the item is the first item in the iterable.
 * - `last: boolean`: True when the item is the last item in the iterable.
 * - `even: boolean`: True when the item has an even index in the iterable.
 * - `odd: boolean`: True when the item has an odd index in the iterable.
 *
 * ```
 * <li *ngFor="let user of userObservable | async as users; index as i; first as isFirst">
 *    {{i}}/{{users.length}}. {{user}} <span *ngIf="isFirst">default</span>
 * </li>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Change Propagation
 *
 * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:
 *
 * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.
 * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.
 * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.
 * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.
 *
 * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce
 * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful
 * controls (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can
 * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state
 * such as user input.
 *
 * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.
 * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that
 * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with
 * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old
 * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should
 * be avoided if possible.
 *
 * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgForOf` supports `trackBy` option.
 * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.
 * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.
 *
 * ### Syntax
 *
 * - `<li *ngFor="let item of items; index as i; trackBy: trackByFn">...</li>`
 *
 * With `<ng-template>` element:
 *
 * ```
 * <ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]="items" let-i="index" [ngForTrackBy]="trackByFn">
 *   <li>...</li>
 * </ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed
 * example.

/**
 * Conditionally includes a template based on the value of an `expression`.
 *
 * `ngIf` evaluates the `expression` and then renders the `then` or `else` template in its place
 * when expression is truthy or falsy respectively. Typically the:
 *  - `then` template is the inline template of `ngIf` unless bound to a different value.
 *  - `else` template is blank unless it is bound.
 *
 * ## Most common usage
 *
 * The most common usage of the `ngIf` directive is to conditionally show the inline template as
 * seen in this example:
 * {\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfSimple'}
 *
 * ## Showing an alternative template using `else`
 *
 * If it is necessary to display a template when the `expression` is falsy use the `else` template
 * binding as shown. Note that the `else` binding points to a `<ng-template>` labeled `#elseBlock`.
 * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view but is typically placed right after
 * `ngIf` for readability.
 *
 * {\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}
 *
 * ## Using non-inlined `then` template
 *
 * Usually the `then` template is the inlined template of the `ngIf`, but it can be changed using
 * a binding (just like `else`). Because `then` and `else` are bindings, the template references can
 * change at runtime as shown in this example.
 *
 * {\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}
 *
 * ## Storing conditional result in a variable
 *
 * A common pattern is that we need to show a set of properties from the same object. If the
 * object is undefined, then we have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to guard against
 * dereferencing a `null` value. This is especially the case when waiting on async data such as
 * when using the `async` pipe as shown in following example:
 *
 * ```
 * Hello {{ (userStream|async)?.last }}, {{ (userStream|async)?.first }}!
 * ```
 *
 * There are several inefficiencies in the above example:
 *  - We create multiple subscriptions on `userStream`. One for each `async` pipe, or two in the
 *    example above.
 *  - We cannot display an alternative screen while waiting for the data to arrive asynchronously.
 *  - We have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties, which is cumbersome.
 *  - We have to place the `async` pipe in parenthesis.
 *
 * A better way to do this is to use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local
 * variable as shown in the the example below:
 *
 * {\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}
 *
 * Notice that:
 *  - We use only one `async` pipe and hence only one subscription gets created.
 *  - `ngIf` stores the result of the `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.
 *  - The local `user` can then be bound repeatedly in a more efficient way.
 *  - No need to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties as `ngIf` will only
 *    display the data if `userStream` returns a value.
 *  - We can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.
 *
 * ### Syntax
 *
 * Simple form:
 * - `<div *ngIf="condition">...</div>`
 * - `<ng-template [ngIf]="condition"><div>...</div></ng-template>`
 *
 * Form with an else block:
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition; else elseBlock">...</div>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * Form with a `then` and `else` block:
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock"></div>
 * <ng-template #thenBlock>...</ng-template>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * Form with storing the value locally:
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition as value; else elseBlock">{{value}}</div>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>
 * ```

/**
 * \@ngModule CommonModule
 * \@whatItDoes Formats a date according to locale rules.
 * \@howToUse `date_expression | date[:format[:timezone[:locale]]]`
 * \@description
 *
 * Where:
 * - `expression` is a date object or a number (milliseconds since UTC epoch) or an ISO string
 * (https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime).
 * - `format` indicates which date/time components to include. The format can be predefined as
 *   shown below (all examples are given for `en-US`) or custom as shown in the table.
 *   - `'short'`: equivalent to `'M/d/yy, h:mm a'` (e.g. `6/15/15, 9:03 AM`)
 *   - `'medium'`: equivalent to `'MMM d, y, h:mm:ss a'` (e.g. `Jun 15, 2015, 9:03:01 AM`)
 *   - `'long'`: equivalent to `'MMMM d, y, h:mm:ss a z'` (e.g. `June 15, 2015 at 9:03:01 AM GMT+1`)
 *   - `'full'`: equivalent to `'EEEE, MMMM d, y, h:mm:ss a zzzz'` (e.g. `Monday, June 15, 2015 at
 * 9:03:01 AM GMT+01:00`)
 *   - `'shortDate'`: equivalent to `'M/d/yy'` (e.g. `6/15/15`)
 *   - `'mediumDate'`: equivalent to `'MMM d, y'` (e.g. `Jun 15, 2015`)
 *   - `'longDate'`: equivalent to `'MMMM d, y'` (e.g. `June 15, 2015`)
 *   - `'fullDate'`: equivalent to `'EEEE, MMMM d, y'` (e.g. `Monday, June 15, 2015`)
 *   - `'shortTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm a'` (e.g. `9:03 AM`)
 *   - `'mediumTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm:ss a'` (e.g. `9:03:01 AM`)
 *   - `'longTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm:ss a z'` (e.g. `9:03:01 AM GMT+1`)
 *   - `'fullTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm:ss a zzzz'` (e.g. `9:03:01 AM GMT+01:00`)
 *  - `timezone` to be used for formatting. It understands UTC/GMT and the continental US time zone
 *  abbreviations, but for general use, use a time zone offset, for example,
 *  `'+0430'` (4 hours, 30 minutes east of the Greenwich meridian)
 *  If not specified, the local system timezone of the end-user's browser will be used.
 *  - `locale` is a `string` defining the locale to use (uses the current {\@link LOCALE_ID} by
 * default)

 * When the expression is a ISO string without time (e.g. 2016-09-19) the time zone offset is not
 * applied and the formatted text will have the same day, month and year of the expression.
 *
 * WARNINGS:
 * - this pipe has only access to en-US locale data by default. If you want to localize the dates
 *   in another language, you will have to import data for other locales.
 *   See the {\@linkDocs guide/i18n#i18n-pipes "I18n guide"} to know how to import additional locale
 *   data.
 * - Fields suffixed with * are only available in the extra dataset.
 *   See the {\@linkDocs guide/i18n#i18n-pipes "I18n guide"} to know how to import extra locale
 *   data.
 * - this pipe is marked as pure hence it will not be re-evaluated when the input is mutated.
 *   Instead users should treat the date as an immutable object and change the reference when the
 *   pipe needs to re-run (this is to avoid reformatting the date on every change detection run
 *   which would be an expensive operation).
 *
 * ### Examples
 *
 * Assuming `dateObj` is (year: 2015, month: 6, day: 15, hour: 21, minute: 43, second: 11)
 * in the _local_ time and locale is 'en-US':
 *
 * {\@example common/pipes/ts/date_pipe.ts region='DatePipe'}

 * \@description
 *
 * Where:
 * - `expression` is a date object or a number (milliseconds since UTC epoch) or an ISO string
 * (https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime).
 * - `format` indicates which date/time components to include. The format can be predefined as
 *   shown below or custom as shown in the table.
 *   - `'medium'`: equivalent to `'yMMMdjms'` (e.g. `Sep 3, 2010, 12:05:08 PM` for `en-US`)
 *   - `'short'`: equivalent to `'yMdjm'` (e.g. `9/3/2010, 12:05 PM` for `en-US`)
 *   - `'fullDate'`: equivalent to `'yMMMMEEEEd'` (e.g. `Friday, September 3, 2010` for `en-US`)
 *   - `'longDate'`: equivalent to `'yMMMMd'` (e.g. `September 3, 2010` for `en-US`)
 *   - `'mediumDate'`: equivalent to `'yMMMd'` (e.g. `Sep 3, 2010` for `en-US`)
 *   - `'shortDate'`: equivalent to `'yMd'` (e.g. `9/3/2010` for `en-US`)
 *   - `'mediumTime'`: equivalent to `'jms'` (e.g. `12:05:08 PM` for `en-US`)
 *   - `'shortTime'`: equivalent to `'jm'` (e.g. `12:05 PM` for `en-US`)

 * In javascript, only the components specified will be respected (not the ordering,
 * punctuations, ...) and details of the formatting will be dependent on the locale.
 *
 * Timezone of the formatted text will be the local system timezone of the end-user's machine.
 *
 * When the expression is a ISO string without time (e.g. 2016-09-19) the time zone offset is not
 * applied and the formatted text will have the same day, month and year of the expression.
 *
 * WARNINGS:
 * - this pipe is marked as pure hence it will not be re-evaluated when the input is mutated.
 *   Instead users should treat the date as an immutable object and change the reference when the
 *   pipe needs to re-run (this is to avoid reformatting the date on every change detection run
 *   which would be an expensive operation).
 * - this pipe uses the Internationalization API. Therefore it is only reliable in Chrome and Opera
 *   browsers.
 *
 * ### Examples
 *
 * Assuming `dateObj` is (year: 2010, month: 9, day: 3, hour: 12 PM, minute: 05, second: 08)
 * in the _local_ time and locale is 'en-US':
 *
 * {\@example common/pipes/ts/date_pipe.ts region='DeprecatedDatePipe'}

 * The `async` pipe subscribes to an `Observable` or `Promise` and returns the latest value it has
 * emitted. When a new value is emitted, the `async` pipe marks the component to be checked for
 * changes. When the component gets destroyed, the `async` pipe unsubscribes automatically to avoid
 * potential memory leaks.
 *
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * This example binds a `Promise` to the view. Clicking the `Resolve` button resolves the
 * promise.
 *
 * {\@example common/pipes/ts/async_pipe.ts region='AsyncPipePromise'}
 *
 * It's also possible to use `async` with Observables. The example below binds the `time` Observable
 * to the view. The Observable continuously updates the view with the current time.

 * - `display` indicates whether to show the currency symbol or the code.
 *   - `code`: use code (e.g. `USD`).
 *   - `symbol`(default): use symbol (e.g. `$`).
 *   - `symbol-narrow`: some countries have two symbols for their currency, one regular and one
 *   narrow (e.g. the canadian dollar CAD has the symbol `CA$` and the symbol-narrow `$`).
 *   - boolean (deprecated from v5): `true` for symbol and false for `code`
 *   If there is no narrow symbol for the chosen currency, the regular symbol will be used.
 * - `digitInfo` See {\@link DecimalPipe} for detailed description.

 * \@description
 *
 * Where the input expression is a `List` or `String`, and:
 * - `start`: The starting index of the subset to return.
 *   - **a positive integer**: return the item at `start` index and all items after
 *     in the list or string expression.
 *   - **a negative integer**: return the item at `start` index from the end and all items after

 *   - **if positive and greater than the size of the expression**: return an empty list or string.
 *   - **if negative and greater than the size of the expression**: return entire list or string.
 * - `end`: The ending index of the subset to return.
 *   - **omitted**: return all items until the end.
 *   - **if positive**: return all items before `end` index of the list or string.
 *   - **if negative**: return all items before `end` index from the end of the list or string.
 *
 * All behavior is based on the expected behavior of the JavaScript API `Array.prototype.slice()`

/**
 * This array represents the DOM schema. It encodes inheritance, properties, and events.
 *
 * ## Overview
 *
 * Each line represents one kind of element. The `element_inheritance` and properties are joined
 * using `element_inheritance|properties` syntax.
 *
 * ## Element Inheritance
 *
 * The `element_inheritance` can be further subdivided as `element1,element2,...^parentElement`.
 * Here the individual elements are separated by `,` (commas). Every element in the list
 * has identical properties.
 *
 * An `element` may inherit additional properties from `parentElement` If no `^parentElement` is
 * specified then `""` (blank) element is assumed.
 *
 * NOTE: The blank element inherits from root `[Element]` element, the super element of all
 * elements.
 *
 * NOTE an element prefix such as `:svg:` has no special meaning to the schema.
 *
 * ## Properties
 *
 * Each element has a set of properties separated by `,` (commas). Each property can be prefixed
 * by a special character designating its type:
 *
 * - (no prefix): property is a string.
 * - `*`: property represents an event.
 * - `!`: property is a boolean.
 * - `#`: property is a number.
 * - `%`: property is an object.
 *
 * ## Query
 *
 * The class creates an internal squas representation which allows to easily answer the query of
 * if a given property exist on a given element.
 *
 * NOTE: We don't yet support querying for types or events.
 * NOTE: This schema is auto extracted from `schema_extractor.ts` located in the test folder,
 *       see dom_element_schema_registry_spec.ts

  This is a limited shim for ShadowDOM css styling.
  https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcomponents/raw-file/tip/spec/shadow/index.html#styles

  The intention here is to support only the styling features which can be
  relatively simply implemented. The goal is to allow users to avoid the
  most obvious pitfalls and do so without compromising performance significantly.
  For ShadowDOM styling that's not covered here, a set of best practices
  can be provided that should allow users to accomplish more complex styling.

  The following is a list of specific ShadowDOM styling features and a brief
  discussion of the approach used to shim.

  Shimmed features:

  * :host, :host-context: ShadowDOM allows styling of the shadowRoot's host
  element using the :host rule. To shim this feature, the :host styles are
  reformatted and prefixed with a given scope name and promoted to a
  document level stylesheet.
  For example, given a scope name of .foo, a rule like this:

    :host {
        background: red;
      }
    }

  becomes:

    .foo {
      background: red;
    }

  * encapsulation: Styles defined within ShadowDOM, apply only to
  dom inside the ShadowDOM. Polymer uses one of two techniques to implement
  this feature.

  By default, rules are prefixed with the host element tag name
  as a descendant selector. This ensures styling does not leak out of the 'top'
  of the element's ShadowDOM. For example,

  div {
      font-weight: bold;
    }

  becomes:

  x-foo div {
      font-weight: bold;
    }

  becomes:


  Alternatively, if WebComponents.ShadowCSS.strictStyling is set to true then
  selectors are scoped by adding an attribute selector suffix to each
  simple selector that contains the host element tag name. Each element
  in the element's ShadowDOM template is also given the scope attribute.
  Thus, these rules match only elements that have the scope attribute.
  For example, given a scope name of x-foo, a rule like this:

    div {
      font-weight: bold;
    }

  becomes:

    div[x-foo] {
      font-weight: bold;
    }

  Note that elements that are dynamically added to a scope must have the scope
  selector added to them manually.

  * upper/lower bound encapsulation: Styles which are defined outside a
  shadowRoot should not cross the ShadowDOM boundary and should not apply
  inside a shadowRoot.

  This styling behavior is not emulated. Some possible ways to do this that
  were rejected due to complexity and/or performance concerns include: (1) reset
  every possible property for every possible selector for a given scope name;
  (2) re-implement css in javascript.

  As an alternative, users should make sure to use selectors
  specific to the scope in which they are working.

  * ::distributed: This behavior is not emulated. It's often not necessary
  to style the contents of a specific insertion point and instead, descendants
  of the host element can be styled selectively. Users can also create an
  extra node around an insertion point and style that node's contents
  via descendent selectors. For example, with a shadowRoot like this:

    <style>
      ::content(div) {
        background: red;
      }
    </style>
    <content></content>

  could become:

    <style>
      / *@polyfill .content-container div * /
      ::content(div) {
        background: red;
      }
    </style>
    <div class="content-container">
      <content></content>
    </div>

  Note the use of @polyfill in the comment above a ShadowDOM specific style
  declaration. This is a directive to the styling shim to use the selector
  in comments in lieu of the next selector when running under polyfill.

 * - convert &ngsp; pseudo-entity to a single space;

 * Removal and trimming of whitespaces have positive performance impact (less code to generate

 * this visitor is not activated by default in Angular 5 and people need to explicitly opt-in for

/**
 * A regular expression for breaking a URI into its component parts.
 *
 * {\@link http://www.gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rfc/rfc3986.html#RFC2234} says
 * As the "first-match-wins" algorithm is identical to the "greedy"
 * disambiguation method used by POSIX regular expressions, it is natural and
 * commonplace to use a regular expression for parsing the potential five
 * components of a URI reference.
 *
 * The following line is the regular expression for breaking-down a
 * well-formed URI reference into its components.
 *
 * <pre>
 * ^(([^:/?#]+):)?(//([^/?#]*))?([^?#]*)(\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))?
 *  12            3  4          5       6  7        8 9
 * </pre>
 *
 * The numbers in the second line above are only to assist readability; they
 * indicate the reference points for each subexpression (i.e., each paired
 * parenthesis). We refer to the value matched for subexpression <n> as $<n>.
 * For example, matching the above expression to
 * <pre>
 *     http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/#Related
 * </pre>
 * results in the following subexpression matches:
 * <pre>
 *    $1 = http:
 *    $2 = http
 *    $3 = //www.ics.uci.edu
 *    $4 = www.ics.uci.edu
 *    $5 = /pub/ietf/uri/
 *    $6 = <undefined>
 *    $7 = <undefined>
 *    $8 = #Related
 *    $9 = Related
 * </pre>
 * where <undefined> indicates that the component is not present, as is the
 * case for the query component in the above example. Therefore, we can
 * determine the value of the five components as
 * <pre>
 *    scheme    = $2
 *    authority = $4
 *    path      = $5
 *    query     = $7
 *    fragment  = $9
 * </pre>
 *
 * The regular expression has been modified slightly to expose the
 * userInfo, domain, and port separately from the authority.
 * The modified version yields
 * <pre>
 *    $1 = http              scheme
 *    $2 = <undefined>       userInfo -\
 *    $3 = www.ics.uci.edu   domain     | authority
 *    $4 = <undefined>       port     -/
 *    $5 = /pub/ietf/uri/    path
 *    $6 = <undefined>       query without ?
 *    $7 = Related           fragment without #
 * </pre>
 * \@internal

 *
 * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/jzjec0?p=preview))

 * expect(car.engine instanceof Engine).toBe(true);
 * ```
 *
 * Notice, we don't use the `new` operator because we explicitly want to have the `Injector`
 * resolve all of the object's dependencies automatically.
 *
 * @deprecated from v5 - slow and brings in a lot of code, Use `Injector.create` instead.

 * Angular. Such tasks can be kicked off via {\@link #runOutsideAngular} and if needed, these tasks
 * can reenter the Angular zone via {\@link #run}.
 *
 * <!-- TODO: add/fix links to:
 *   - docs explaining zones and the use of zones in Angular and change-detection
 *   - link to runOutsideAngular/run (throughout this file!)

/**
 * Represents an Angular View.
 *
 * <!-- TODO: move the next two paragraphs to the dev guide -->
 * A View is a fundamental building block of the application UI. It is the smallest grouping of
 * Elements which are created and destroyed together.
 *
 * Properties of elements in a View can change, but the structure (number and order) of elements in
 * a View cannot. Changing the structure of Elements can only be done by inserting, moving or
 * removing nested Views via a {\@link ViewContainerRef}. Each View can contain many View Containers.
 * <!-- /TODO -->
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * Given this template...
 *
 * ```
 * Count: {{items.length}}
 * <ul>
 *   <li *ngFor="let  item of items">{{item}}</li>
 * </ul>
 * ```
 *
 * We have two {\@link TemplateRef}s:
 *
 * Outer {\@link TemplateRef}:
 * ```
 * Count: {{items.length}}
 * <ul>
 *   <ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]="items"></ng-template>
 * </ul>
 * ```
 *
 * Inner {\@link TemplateRef}:
 * ```
 *   <li>{{item}}</li>
 * ```
 *
 * Notice that the original template is broken down into two separate {\@link TemplateRef}s.
 *
 * The outer/inner {\@link TemplateRef}s are then assembled into views like so:
 *
 * ```
 * <!-- ViewRef: outer-0 -->
 * Count: 2
 * <ul>
 *   <ng-template view-container-ref></ng-template>
 *   <!-- ViewRef: inner-1 --><li>first</li><!-- /ViewRef: inner-1 -->
 *   <!-- ViewRef: inner-2 --><li>second</li><!-- /ViewRef: inner-2 -->
 * </ul>
 * <!-- /ViewRef: outer-0 -->
 * ```

/**
 * `trigger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the
 * {\@link Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better
 * understanding of how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `trigger` Creates an animation trigger which will a list of {\@link state state} and
 * {\@link transition transition} entries that will be evaluated when the expression
 * bound to the trigger changes.
 *
 * Triggers are registered within the component annotation data under the
 * {\@link Component#animations animations section}. An animation trigger can be placed on an element
 * within a template by referencing the name of the trigger followed by the expression value that
 * the
 * trigger is bound to (in the form of `[\@triggerName]="expression"`.
 *
 * Animation trigger bindings strigify values and then match the previous and current values against
 * any linked transitions. If a boolean value is provided into the trigger binding then it will both
 * be represented as `1` or `true` and `0` or `false` for a true and false boolean values
 * respectively.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `trigger` will create an animation trigger reference based on the provided `name` value. The
 * provided `animation` value is expected to be an array consisting of {\@link state state} and
 * {\@link transition transition} declarations.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *       state(...),
 *       state(...),
 *       transition(...),
 *       transition(...)
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   myStatusExp = "something";
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation
 * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->
 * <div [\@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Disable Animations
 * A special animation control binding called `\@.disabled` can be placed on an element which will
 * then disable animations for any inner animation triggers situated within the element as well as
 * any animations on the element itself.
 *
 * When true, the `\@.disabled` binding will prevent all animations from rendering. The example
 * below shows how to use this feature:
 *
 * ```ts
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   template: `
 *     <div [\@.disabled]="isDisabled">
 *       <div [\@childAnimation]="exp"></div>
 *     </div>
 *   `,
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger("childAnimation", [
 *       // ...
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   isDisabled = true;
 *   exp = '...';
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The `\@childAnimation` trigger will not animate because `\@.disabled` prevents it from happening
 * (when true).
 *
 * Note that `\@.disabled` will only disable all animations (this means any animations running on
 * the same element will also be disabled).
 *
 * ### Disabling Animations Application-wide
 * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled, **all** inner components will
 * also have their animations disabled as well. This means that all animations for an angular
 * application can be disabled by placing a host binding set on `\@.disabled` on the topmost Angular
 * component.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import {Component, HostBinding} from '\@angular/core';
 *
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'app-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',
 * })
 * class AppComponent {
 *   \@HostBinding('\@.disabled')
 *   public animationsDisabled = true;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### What about animations that us `query()` and `animateChild()`?
 * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can {\@link query query} for inner
 * elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate them as it sees fit. This is
 * also the case for when a sub animation is queried by a parent and then later animated using {\@link
 * animateChild animateChild}.
 *
 * \@experimental Animation support is experimental.

 * `animate` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of
 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `animate` specifies an animation step that will apply the provided `styles` data for a given
 * amount of time based on the provided `timing` expression value. Calls to `animate` are expected
 * to be used within {\@link sequence an animation sequence}, {\@link group group}, or {\@link
 * transition transition}.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:
 *
 * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional delay
 * and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`
 * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,
 * delay=100, easing=ease-out`. If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the
 * `duration` value in millisecond form.
 * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {\@link style style} or {\@link
 * keyframes keyframes}. If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected
 * and used (this is useful when describing an animation step that will complete an animation by
 * {\@link transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // various functions for specifying timing data
 * animate(500, style(...))
 * animate("1s", style(...))
 * animate("100ms 0.5s", style(...))
 * animate("5s ease", style(...))
 * animate("5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)", style(...))
 *
 * // either style() of keyframes() can be used
 * animate(500, style({ background: "red" }))
 * animate(500, keyframes([
 *   style({ background: "blue" })),
 *   style({ background: "red" }))
 * ])

 *
 * `group` specifies a list of animation steps that are all run in parallel. Grouped animations are
 * useful when a series of styles must be animated/closed off at different starting/ending times.
 *
 * The `group` function can either be used within a {\@link sequence sequence} or a {\@link transition
 * transition} and it will only continue to the next instruction once all of the inner animation
 * steps have completed.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `steps` data that is passed into the `group` animation function can either consist of {\@link
 * style style} or {\@link animate animate} function calls. Each call to `style()` or `animate()`
 * within a group will be executed instantly (use {\@link keyframes keyframes} or a {\@link
 * animate#usage animate() with a delay value} to offset styles to be applied at a later time).
 *
 * ```typescript

 *   animate("1s", { background: "black" }))
 *   animate("2s", { color: "white" }))

 *
 * `sequence` Specifies a list of animation steps that are run one by one. (`sequence` is used by
 * default when an array is passed as animation data into {\@link transition transition}.)
 *
 * The `sequence` function can either be used within a {\@link group group} or a {\@link transition

 *
 * ### Usage
 *

 *
 * `style` declares a key/value object containing CSS properties/styles that can then be used for
 * {\@link state animation states}, within an {\@link sequence animation sequence}, or as styling data
 * for both {\@link animate animate} and {\@link keyframes keyframes}.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `style` takes in a key/value string map as data and expects one or more CSS property/value pairs
 * to be defined.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // string values are used for css properties
 * style({ background: "red", color: "blue" })
 *
 * // numerical (pixel) values are also supported

 * ```
 *
 * #### Auto-styles (using `*`)
 *
 * When an asterix (`*`) character is used as a value then it will be detected from the element
 * being animated and applied as animation data when the animation starts.
 *
 * This feature proves useful for a state depending on layout and/or environment factors; in such
 * cases the styles are calculated just before the animation starts.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // the steps below will animate from 0 to the
 * // actual height of the element
 * style({ height: 0 }),
 * animate("1s", style({ height: "*" }))
 * ```
 *
 * {\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}

 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of
 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `state` declares an animation state within the given trigger. When a state is active within a
 * component then its associated styles will persist on the element that the trigger is attached to
 * (even when the animation ends).
 *
 * To animate between states, have a look at the animation {\@link transition transition} DSL
 * function. To register states to an animation trigger please have a look at the {\@link trigger
 * trigger} function.
 *
 * #### The `void` state
 *
 * The `void` state value is a reserved word that angular uses to determine when the element is not
 * apart of the application anymore (e.g. when an `ngIf` evaluates to false then the state of the
 * associated element is void).
 *
 * #### The `*` (default) state
 *
 * The `*` state (when styled) is a fallback state that will be used if the state that is being
 * animated is not declared within the trigger.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `state` will declare an animation state with its associated styles
 * within the given trigger.
 *
 * - `stateNameExpr` can be one or more state names separated by commas.
 * - `styles` refers to the {\@link style styling data} that will be persisted on the element once
 * the state has been reached.

 *
 * // user-defined states

 *
 * `keyframes` specifies a collection of {\@link style style} entries each optionally characterized
 * by an `offset` value.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `keyframes` animation function is designed to be used alongside the {\@link animate animate}
 * animation function. Instead of applying animations from where they are currently to their
 * destination, keyframes can describe how each style entry is applied and at what point within the
 * animation arc (much like CSS Keyframe Animations do).
 *
 * For each `style()` entry an `offset` value can be set. Doing so allows to specifiy at what
 * percentage of the animate time the styles will be applied.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // the provided offset values describe when each backgroundColor value is applied.
 * animate("5s", keyframes([
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "red", offset: 0 }),
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "blue", offset: 0.2 }),
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "orange", offset: 0.3 }),
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "black", offset: 1 })
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, if there are no `offset` values used within the style entries then the offsets
 * will be calculated automatically.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * animate("5s", keyframes([
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "red" }) // offset = 0
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "blue" }) // offset = 0.33
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "orange" }) // offset = 0.66
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "black" }) // offset = 1
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * {\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}

/**
 * `transition` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of
 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `transition` declares the {\@link sequence sequence of animation steps} that will be run when the
 * provided `stateChangeExpr` value is satisfied. The `stateChangeExpr` consists of a `state1 =>
 * state2` which consists of two known states (use an asterix (`*`) to refer to a dynamic starting
 * and/or ending state).
 *
 * A function can also be provided as the `stateChangeExpr` argument for a transition and this
 * function will be executed each time a state change occurs. If the value returned within the
 * function is true then the associated animation will be run.
 *
 * Animation transitions are placed within an {\@link trigger animation trigger}. For an transition
 * to animate to a state value and persist its styles then one or more {\@link state animation
 * states} is expected to be defined.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * An animation transition is kicked off the `stateChangeExpr` predicate evaluates to true based on
 * what the previous state is and what the current state has become. In other words, if a transition
 * is defined that matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be
 * triggered.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger
 * trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the
 *   // animation has fully completed itself
 *   state("on", style({ background: "green" })),
 *   state("off", style({ background: "grey" })),
 *
 *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value
 *   // bound to "myAnimationTrigger" changes from "on" to "off"
 *   transition("on => off", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions
 *   transition("on <=> off", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas
 *   transition("on => off, off => void", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into
 *   // the page and the destination state is unknown
 *   transition("void => *", [
 *     style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *     animate(500)
 *   ]),
 *
 *   // this will capture a state change between any states
 *   transition("* => *", animate("1s 0s")),
 *
 *   // you can also go full out and include a function
 *   transition((fromState, toState) => {
 *     // when `true` then it will allow the animation below to be invoked
 *     return fromState == "off" && toState == "on";
 *   }, animate("1s 0s"))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation
 * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->
 * <div [\@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * #### The final `animate` call
 *
 * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only** uses a
 * timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final animation arc
 * for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of
 * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the
 * applied state to be presented correctly.
 *
 * ```
 * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state
 * // is currently active for "myAnimationTrigger"
 * transition("void => *", [
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(500)
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using :enter and :leave
 *
 * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common, the `transition`
 * function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which are aliases for the `void => *` and `*
 * => void` state changes.
 *
 * ```
 * transition(":enter", [
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 * ]),
 * transition(":leave", [
 *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Boolean values
 * if a trigger binding value is a boolean value then it can be matched using a transition
 * expression that compares `true` and `false` or `1` and `0`.
 *
 * ```
 * // in the template
 * <div [\@openClose]="open ? true : false">...</div>
 *
 * // in the component metadata
 * trigger('openClose', [
 *   state('true', style({ height: '*' })),
 *   state('false', style({ height: '0px' })),
 *   transition('false <=> true', animate(500))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using :increment and :decrement
 * In addition to the :enter and :leave transition aliases, the :increment and :decrement aliases
 * can be used to kick off a transition when a numeric value has increased or decreased in value.
 *
 * ```
 * import {group, animate, query, transition, style, trigger} from '\@angular/animations';
 * import {Component} from '\@angular/core';
 *
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'banner-carousel-component',

/**
 * `animateChild` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. It works by allowing a queried element to execute its own
 * animation within the animation sequence.
 *
 * Each time an animation is triggered in angular, the parent animation
 * will always get priority and any child animations will be blocked. In order
 * for a child animation to run, the parent animation must query each of the elements
 * containing child animations and then allow the animations to run using `animateChild`.
 *
 * The example HTML code below shows both parent and child elements that have animation
 * triggers that will execute at the same time.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- parent-child.component.html -->
 * <button (click)="exp =! exp">Toggle</button>
 * <hr>
 *
 * <div [\@parentAnimation]="exp">
 *   <header>Hello</header>
 *   <div [\@childAnimation]="exp">
 *       one
 *   </div>
 *   <div [\@childAnimation]="exp">
 *       two
 *   </div>
 *   <div [\@childAnimation]="exp">
 *       three
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * Now when the `exp` value changes to true, only the `parentAnimation` animation will animate
 * because it has priority. However, using `query` and `animateChild` each of the inner animations
 * can also fire:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // parent-child.component.ts
 * import {trigger, transition, animate, style, query, animateChild} from '\@angular/animations';
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'parent-child-component',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger('parentAnimation', [
 *       transition('false => true', [
 *         query('header', [
 *           style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *           animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *         ]),
 *         query('\@childAnimation', [
 *           animateChild()
 *         ])
 *       ])
 *     ]),
 *     trigger('childAnimation', [
 *       transition('false => true', [
 *         style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *         animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *       ])
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class ParentChildCmp {
 *   exp: boolean = false;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * In the animation code above, when the `parentAnimation` transition kicks off it first queries to
 * find the header element and fades it in. It then finds each of the sub elements that contain the
 * `\@childAnimation` trigger and then allows for their animations to fire.
 *
 * This example can be further extended by using stagger:
 *
 * ```ts
 * query('\@childAnimation', stagger(100, [
 *   animateChild()
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * Now each of the sub animations start off with respect to the `100ms` staggering step.
 *
 * ## The first frame of child animations
 * When sub animations are executed using `animateChild` the animation engine will always apply the
 * first frame of every sub animation immediately at the start of the animation sequence. This way
 * the parent animation does not need to set any initial styling data on the sub elements before the
 * sub animations kick off.
 *
 * In the example above the first frame of the `childAnimation`'s `false => true` transition
 * consists of a style of `opacity: 0`. This is applied immediately when the `parentAnimation`
 * animation transition sequence starts. Only then when the `\@childAnimation` is queried and called
 * with `animateChild` will it then animate to its destination of `opacity: 1`.
 *
 * Note that this feature designed to be used alongside {\@link query query()} and it will only work
 * with animations that are assigned using the Angular animation DSL (this means that CSS keyframes
 * and transitions are not handled by this API).

/**
 * `query` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language.
 *
 * query() is used to find one or more inner elements within the current element that is
 * being animated within the sequence. The provided animation steps are applied
 * to the queried element (by default, an array is provided, then this will be
 * treated as an animation sequence).
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * query() is designed to collect mutiple elements and works internally by using
 * `element.querySelectorAll`. An additional options object can be provided which
 * can be used to limit the total amount of items to be collected.
 *
 * ```js
 * query('div', [
 *   animate(...),
 *   animate(...)
 * ], { limit: 1 })
 * ```
 *
 * query(), by default, will throw an error when zero items are found. If a query
 * has the `optional` flag set to true then this error will be ignored.
 *
 * ```js
 * query('.some-element-that-may-not-be-there', [
 *   animate(...),
 *   animate(...)
 * ], { optional: true })
 * ```
 *
 * ### Special Selector Values
 *
 * The selector value within a query can collect elements that contain angular-specific
 * characteristics
 * using special pseudo-selectors tokens.
 *
 * These include:
 *
 *  - Querying for newly inserted/removed elements using `query(":enter")`/`query(":leave")`
 *  - Querying all currently animating elements using `query(":animating")`
 *  - Querying elements that contain an animation trigger using `query("\@triggerName")`
 *  - Querying all elements that contain an animation triggers using `query("\@*")`
 *  - Including the current element into the animation sequence using `query(":self")`
 *
 *
 *  Each of these pseudo-selector tokens can be merged together into a combined query selector
 * string:
 *
 *  ```
 *  query(':self, .record:enter, .record:leave, \@subTrigger', [...])
 *  ```
 *
 * ### Demo
 *
 * ```
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'inner',
 *   template: `
 *     <div [\@queryAnimation]="exp">
 *       <h1>Title</h1>
 *       <div class="content">
 *         Blah blah blah
 *       </div>
 *     </div>
 *   `,
 *   animations: [
 *    trigger('queryAnimation', [
 *      transition('* => goAnimate', [
 *        // hide the inner elements
 *        query('h1', style({ opacity: 0 })),
 *        query('.content', style({ opacity: 0 })),
 *
 *        // animate the inner elements in, one by one
 *        query('h1', animate(1000, style({ opacity: 1 })),
 *        query('.content', animate(1000, style({ opacity: 1 })),
 *      ])
 *    ])
 *  ]
 * })

 *     this.exp = 'goAnimate';

/**
 * `stagger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. It is designed to be used inside of an animation {\@link query query()}
 * and works by issuing a timing gap between after each queried item is animated.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * In the example below there is a container element that wraps a list of items stamped out
 * by an ngFor. The container element contains an animation trigger that will later be set
 * to query for each of the inner items.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- list.component.html -->
 * <button (click)="toggle()">Show / Hide Items</button>
 * <hr />
 * <div [\@listAnimation]="items.length">
 *   <div *ngFor="let item of items">
 *     {{ item }}
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * The component code for this looks as such:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import {trigger, transition, style, animate, query, stagger} from '\@angular/animations';
 * \@Component({
 *   templateUrl: 'list.component.html',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger('listAnimation', [
 *        //...
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class ListComponent {
 *   items = [];
 *
 *   showItems() {
 *     this.items = [0,1,2,3,4];
 *   }
 *
 *   hideItems() {
 *     this.items = [];
 *   }
 *
 *   toggle() {
 *     this.items.length ? this.hideItems() : this.showItems();
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * And now for the animation trigger code:
 *
 * ```ts
 * trigger('listAnimation', [
 *   transition('* => *', [ // each time the binding value changes
 *     query(':leave', [
 *       stagger(100, [
 *         animate('0.5s', style({ opacity: 0 }))
 *       ])
 *     ]),
 *     query(':enter', [
 *       style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *       stagger(100, [
 *         animate('0.5s', style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *       ])
 *     ])
 *   ])
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * Now each time the items are added/removed then either the opacity
 * fade-in animation will run or each removed item will be faded out.
 * When either of these animations occur then a stagger effect will be
 * applied after each item's animation is started.
 *

 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * If you have imported the {\@link FormsModule} or the {\@link ReactiveFormsModule}, this
 * value accessor will be active on any select control that has a form directive. You do
 * **not** need to add a special selector to activate it.
 *
 * ### How to use select controls with form directives
 *
 * To use a select in a template-driven form, simply add an `ngModel` and a `name`
 * attribute to the main `<select>` tag.
 *
 * If your option values are simple strings, you can bind to the normal `value` property
 * on the option.  If your option values happen to be objects (and you'd like to save the
 * selection in your form as an object), use `ngValue` instead:
 *
 * {\@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * In reactive forms, you'll also want to add your form directive (`formControlName` or
 * `formControl`) on the main `<select>` tag. Like in the former example, you have the
 * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.
 *
 * {\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * ### Caveat: Option selection
 *
 * Angular uses object identity to select option. It's possible for the identities of items
 * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced
 * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the
 * second response will produce objects with different identities.
 *
 * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select>` supports `compareWith` input.
 * `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.
 * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects option by the return value of the function.
 *
 * #### Syntax
 *
 * ```
 * <select [compareWith]="compareFn"  [(ngModel)]="selectedCountries">
 *     <option *ngFor="let country of countries" [ngValue]="country">
 *         {{country.name}}
 *     </option>
 * </select>
 *
 * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {
 *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired
 * for selects in Firefox and IE:
 * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350
 * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/

/**
 * The accessor for writing a value and listening to changes on a select element.
 *
 *  ### Caveat: Options selection
 *
 * Angular uses object identity to select options. It's possible for the identities of items
 * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced
 * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the
 * second response will produce objects with different identities.
 *
 * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select multiple>` supports `compareWith`
 * input. `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.
 * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects options by the return value of the function.
 *
 * #### Syntax
 *
 * ```
 * <select multiple [compareWith]="compareFn"  [(ngModel)]="selectedCountries">
 *     <option *ngFor="let country of countries" [ngValue]="country">
 *         {{country.name}}
 *     </option>
 * </select>
 *
 * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {
 *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;
 * }
 * ```

 * \@whatItDoes Tracks the value and validation status of an individual form control.
 *
 * It is one of the three fundamental building blocks of Angular forms, along with
 * {\@link FormGroup} and {\@link FormArray}.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * When instantiating a {\@link FormControl}, you can pass in an initial value as the
 * first argument. Example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const ctrl = new FormControl('some value');
 * console.log(ctrl.value);     // 'some value'
 * ```
 *
 * You can also initialize the control with a form state object on instantiation,
 * which includes both the value and whether or not the control is disabled.
 * You can't use the value key without the disabled key; both are required
 * to use this way of initialization.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const ctrl = new FormControl({value: 'n/a', disabled: true});
 * console.log(ctrl.value);     // 'n/a'
 * console.log(ctrl.status);   // 'DISABLED'
 * ```
 *
 * The second {\@link FormControl} argument can accept one of three things:
 * * a sync validator function
 * * an array of sync validator functions
 * * an options object containing validator and/or async validator functions
 *
 * Example of a single sync validator function:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const ctrl = new FormControl('', Validators.required);
 * console.log(ctrl.value);     // ''
 * console.log(ctrl.status);   // 'INVALID'
 * ```
 *
 * Example using options object:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const ctrl = new FormControl('', {
 *    validators: Validators.required,
 *    asyncValidators: myAsyncValidator
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The options object can also be used to define when the control should update.
 * By default, the value and validity of a control updates whenever the value
 * changes. You can configure it to update on the blur event instead by setting
 * the `updateOn` option to `'blur'`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const c = new FormControl('', { updateOn: 'blur' });
 * ```
 *
 * You can also set `updateOn` to `'submit'`, which will delay value and validity
 * updates until the parent form of the control fires a submit event.
 *
 * See its superclass, {\@link AbstractControl}, for more properties and methods.
 *
 * * **npm package**: `\@angular/forms`
 *

/**
 * \@whatItDoes Tracks the value and validity state of a group of {\@link FormControl}
 * instances.
 *
 * A `FormGroup` aggregates the values of each child {\@link FormControl} into one object,
 * with each control name as the key.  It calculates its status by reducing the statuses
 * of its children. For example, if one of the controls in a group is invalid, the entire
 * group becomes invalid.
 *
 * `FormGroup` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,
 * along with {\@link FormControl} and {\@link FormArray}.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * When instantiating a {\@link FormGroup}, pass in a collection of child controls as the first
 * argument. The key for each child will be the name under which it is registered.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   first: new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   last: new FormControl('Drew'),
 * });
 *
 * console.log(form.value);   // {first: 'Nancy', last; 'Drew'}
 * console.log(form.status);  // 'VALID'
 * ```
 *
 * You can also include group-level validators as the second arg, or group-level async
 * validators as the third arg. These come in handy when you want to perform validation
 * that considers the value of more than one child control.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   password: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),
 * }, passwordMatchValidator);
 *
 *
 * function passwordMatchValidator(g: FormGroup) {
 *    return g.get('password').value === g.get('passwordConfirm').value
 *       ? null : {'mismatch': true};
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Like {\@link FormControl} instances, you can alternatively choose to pass in
 * validators and async validators as part of an options object.
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   password: new FormControl('')
 *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('')
 * }, {validators: passwordMatchValidator, asyncValidators: otherValidator});
 * ```
 *
 * The options object can also be used to set a default value for each child
 * control's `updateOn` property. If you set `updateOn` to `'blur'` at the
 * group level, all child controls will default to 'blur', unless the child
 * has explicitly specified a different `updateOn` value.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const c = new FormGroup({
 *    one: new FormControl()
 * }, {updateOn: 'blur'});
 * ```
 *

/**
 * \@whatItDoes Tracks the value and validity state of an array of {\@link FormControl},
 * {\@link FormGroup} or {\@link FormArray} instances.
 *
 * A `FormArray` aggregates the values of each child {\@link FormControl} into an array.
 * It calculates its status by reducing the statuses of its children. For example, if one of
 * the controls in a `FormArray` is invalid, the entire array becomes invalid.
 *
 * `FormArray` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,
 * along with {\@link FormControl} and {\@link FormGroup}.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * When instantiating a {\@link FormArray}, pass in an array of child controls as the first
 * argument.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```
 * const arr = new FormArray([
 *   new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   new FormControl('Drew'),
 * ]);
 *
 * console.log(arr.value);   // ['Nancy', 'Drew']
 * console.log(arr.status);  // 'VALID'
 * ```
 *
 * You can also include array-level validators and async validators. These come in handy
 * when you want to perform validation that considers the value of more than one child
 * control.
 *
 * The two types of validators can be passed in separately as the second and third arg
 * respectively, or together as part of an options object.
 *
 * ```
 * const arr = new FormArray([
 *   new FormControl('Nancy'),
 *   new FormControl('Drew')
 * ], {validators: myValidator, asyncValidators: myAsyncValidator});
 * ```
 *
 * The options object can also be used to set a default value for each child
 * control's `updateOn` property. If you set `updateOn` to `'blur'` at the
 * array level, all child controls will default to 'blur', unless the child
 * has explicitly specified a different `updateOn` value.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const c = new FormArray([
 *    new FormControl()
 * ], {updateOn: 'blur'});
 * ```
 *
 * ### Adding or removing controls
 *
 * To change the controls in the array, use the `push`, `insert`, or `removeAt` methods
 * in `FormArray` itself. These methods ensure the controls are properly tracked in the
 * form's hierarchy. Do not modify the array of `AbstractControl`s used to instantiate
 * the `FormArray` directly, as that will result in strange and unexpected behavior such
 * as broken change detection.
 *
 * * **npm package**: `\@angular/forms`

 * \@whatItDoes Creates a top-level {\@link FormGroup} instance and binds it to a form
 * to track aggregate form value and validation status.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * As soon as you import the `FormsModule`, this directive becomes active by default on
 * all `<form>` tags.  You don't need to add a special selector.
 *
 * You can export the directive into a local template variable using `ngForm` as the key
 * (ex: `#myForm="ngForm"`). This is optional, but useful.  Many properties from the underlying
 * {\@link FormGroup} instance are duplicated on the directive itself, so a reference to it
 * will give you access to the aggregate value and validity status of the form, as well as
 * user interaction properties like `dirty` and `touched`.
 *
 * To register child controls with the form, you'll want to use {\@link NgModel} with a
 * `name` attribute.  You can also use {\@link NgModelGroup} if you'd like to create
 * sub-groups within the form.
 *
 * You can listen to the directive's `ngSubmit` event to be notified when the user has
 * triggered a form submission. The `ngSubmit` event will be emitted with the original form
 * submission event.
 *
 * In template driven forms, all `<form>` tags are automatically tagged as `NgForm`.
 * If you want to import the `FormsModule` but skip its usage in some forms,
 * for example, to use native HTML5 validation, you can add `ngNoForm` and the `<form>`
 * tags won't create an `NgForm` directive. In reactive forms, using `ngNoForm` is
 * unnecessary because the `<form>` tags are inert. In that case, you would
 * refrain from using the `formGroup` directive.

/**
 * \@whatItDoes Creates a {\@link FormControl} instance from a domain model and binds it
 * to a form control element.
 *
 * The {\@link FormControl} instance will track the value, user interaction, and
 * validation status of the control and keep the view synced with the model. If used
 * within a parent form, the directive will also register itself with the form as a child
 * control.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * This directive can be used by itself or as part of a larger form. All you need is the
 * `ngModel` selector to activate it.
 *
 * It accepts a domain model as an optional {\@link Input}. If you have a one-way binding
 * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component
 * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax
 * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to
 * the domain model in your class as well.
 *
 * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {\@link FormControl} (like
 * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using
 * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar="ngModel"`). You can then access the control using the
 * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)
 * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a
 * full list of properties directly available in {\@link AbstractControlDirective}.
 *
 * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:
 *
 * {\@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute
 * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.
 *
 * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or
 * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access
 * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:
 * `#f="ngForm"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.
 *
 * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for
 * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather
 * than the domain model's value on submit.
 *
 * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:
 *
 * {\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:
 *
 * * Radio buttons: {\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}
 * * Selects: {\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}

 * \@whatItDoes Syncs a standalone {\@link FormControl} instance to a form control element.
 *
 * In other words, this directive ensures that any values written to the {\@link FormControl}
 * instance programmatically will be written to the DOM element (model -> view). Conversely,
 * any values written to the DOM element through user input will be reflected in the
 * {\@link FormControl} instance (view -> model).
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * Use this directive if you'd like to create and manage a {\@link FormControl} instance directly.
 * Simply create a {\@link FormControl}, save it to your component class, and pass it into the
 * {\@link FormControlDirective}.
 *
 * This directive is designed to be used as a standalone control.  Unlike {\@link FormControlName},
 * it does not require that your {\@link FormControl} instance be part of any parent
 * {\@link FormGroup}, and it won't be registered to any {\@link FormGroupDirective} that
 * exists above it.
 *
 * **Get the value**: the `value` property is always synced and available on the
 * {\@link FormControl} instance. See a full list of available properties in
 * {\@link AbstractControl}.
 *
 * **Set the value**: You can pass in an initial value when instantiating the {\@link FormControl},
 * or you can set it programmatically later using {\@link AbstractControl#setValue setValue} or
 * {\@link AbstractControl#patchValue patchValue}.
 *
 * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the control, you can
 * subscribe to the {\@link AbstractControl#valueChanges valueChanges} event.  You can also listen to
 * {\@link AbstractControl#statusChanges statusChanges} to be notified when the validation status is
 * re-calculated.

/**
 * \@whatItDoes Binds an existing {\@link FormGroup} to a DOM element.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * This directive accepts an existing {\@link FormGroup} instance. It will then use this
 * {\@link FormGroup} instance to match any child {\@link FormControl}, {\@link FormGroup},
 * and {\@link FormArray} instances to child {\@link FormControlName}, {\@link FormGroupName},
 * and {\@link FormArrayName} directives.
 *
 * **Set value**: You can set the form's initial value when instantiating the
 * {\@link FormGroup}, or you can set it programmatically later using the {\@link FormGroup}'s
 * {\@link AbstractControl#setValue setValue} or {\@link AbstractControl#patchValue patchValue}
 * methods.
 *
 * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the form, you can subscribe
 * to the {\@link FormGroup}'s {\@link AbstractControl#valueChanges valueChanges} event.  You can also
 * listen to its {\@link AbstractControl#statusChanges statusChanges} event to be notified when the
 * validation status is re-calculated.
 *
 * Furthermore, you can listen to the directive's `ngSubmit` event to be notified when the user has
 * triggered a form submission. The `ngSubmit` event will be emitted with the original form
 * submission event.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * In this example, we create form controls for first name and last name.
 *

 * \@whatItDoes Syncs a nested {\@link FormGroup} to a DOM element.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * This directive can only be used with a parent {\@link FormGroupDirective} (selector:
 * `[formGroup]`).
 *
 * It accepts the string name of the nested {\@link FormGroup} you want to link, and
 * will look for a {\@link FormGroup} registered with that name in the parent
 * {\@link FormGroup} instance you passed into {\@link FormGroupDirective}.
 *
 * Nested form groups can come in handy when you want to validate a sub-group of a
 * form separately from the rest or when you'd like to group the values of certain
 * controls into their own nested object.
 *
 * **Access the group**: You can access the associated {\@link FormGroup} using the
 * {\@link AbstractControl#get get} method. Ex: `this.form.get('name')`.
 *
 * You can also access individual controls within the group using dot syntax.
 * Ex: `this.form.get('name.first')`
 *
 * **Get the value**: the `value` property is always synced and available on the
 * {\@link FormGroup}. See a full list of available properties in {\@link AbstractControl}.
 *
 * **Set the value**: You can set an initial value for each child control when instantiating
 * the {\@link FormGroup}, or you can set it programmatically later using
 * {\@link AbstractControl#setValue setValue} or {\@link AbstractControl#patchValue patchValue}.
 *
 * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the group, you can
 * subscribe to the {\@link AbstractControl#valueChanges valueChanges} event.  You can also listen to
 * {\@link AbstractControl#statusChanges statusChanges} to be notified when the validation status is

/**
 * A pattern that recognizes a commonly useful subset of URLs that are safe.
 *
 * This regular expression matches a subset of URLs that will not cause script
 * execution if used in URL context within a HTML document. Specifically, this
 * regular expression matches if (comment from here on and regex copied from
 * Soy's EscapingConventions):
 * (1) Either a protocol in a whitelist (http, https, mailto or ftp).
 * (2) or no protocol.  A protocol must be followed by a colon. The below
 *     allows that by allowing colons only after one of the characters [/?#].
 *     A colon after a hash (#) must be in the fragment.
 *     Otherwise, a colon after a (?) must be in a query.
 *     Otherwise, a colon after a single solidus (/) must be in a path.
 *     Otherwise, a colon after a double solidus (//) must be in the authority
 *     (before port).
 *
 * The pattern disallows &, used in HTML entity declarations before
 * one of the characters in [/?#]. This disallows HTML entities used in the
 * protocol name, which should never happen, e.g. "h&#116;tp" for "http".
 * It also disallows HTML entities in the first path part of a relative path,
 * e.g. "foo&lt;bar/baz".  Our existing escaping functions should not produce
 * that. More importantly, it disallows masking of a colon,
 * e.g. "javascript&#58;...".
 *
 * This regular expression was taken from the Closure sanitization library.

/**
 * DomSanitizer helps preventing Cross Site Scripting Security bugs (XSS) by sanitizing
 * values to be safe to use in the different DOM contexts.
 *
 * For example, when binding a URL in an `<a [href]="someValue">` hyperlink, `someValue` will be
 * sanitized so that an attacker cannot inject e.g. a `javascript:` URL that would execute code on
 * the website.
 *
 * In specific situations, it might be necessary to disable sanitization, for example if the
 * application genuinely needs to produce a `javascript:` style link with a dynamic value in it.
 * Users can bypass security by constructing a value with one of the `bypassSecurityTrust...`
 * methods, and then binding to that value from the template.
 *
 * These situations should be very rare, and extraordinary care must be taken to avoid creating a
 * Cross Site Scripting (XSS) security bug!
 *
 * When using `bypassSecurityTrust...`, make sure to call the method as early as possible and as
 * close as possible to the source of the value, to make it easy to verify no security bug is
 * created by its use.
 *
 * It is not required (and not recommended) to bypass security if the value is safe, e.g. a URL that
 * does not start with a suspicious protocol, or an HTML snippet that does not contain dangerous
 * code. The sanitizer leaves safe values intact.
 *
 * \@security Calling any of the `bypassSecurityTrust...` APIs disables Angular's built-in
 * sanitization for the value passed in. Carefully check and audit all values and code paths going
 * into this call. Make sure any user data is appropriately escaped for this security context.
 * For more detail, see the [Security Guide](http://g.co/ng/security).

/**
 * \@whatItDoes Lets you link to specific parts of your app.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * Consider the following route configuration:
 * `[{ path: 'user/:name', component: UserCmp }]`
 *
 * When linking to this `user/:name` route, you can write:
 * `<a routerLink='/user/bob'>link to user component</a>`
 *
 * \@description
 *
 * The RouterLink directives let you link to specific parts of your app.
 *
 * When the link is static, you can use the directive as follows:
 * `<a routerLink="/user/bob">link to user component</a>`
 *
 * If you use dynamic values to generate the link, you can pass an array of path
 * segments, followed by the params for each segment.
 *
 * For instance `['/team', teamId, 'user', userName, {details: true}]`
 * means that we want to generate a link to `/team/11/user/bob;details=true`.
 *
 * Multiple static segments can be merged into one
 * (e.g., `['/team/11/user', userName, {details: true}]`).
 *
 * The first segment name can be prepended with `/`, `./`, or `../`:
 * * If the first segment begins with `/`, the router will look up the route from the root of the
 *   app.
 * * If the first segment begins with `./`, or doesn't begin with a slash, the router will
 *   instead look in the children of the current activated route.
 * * And if the first segment begins with `../`, the router will go up one level.
 *
 * You can set query params and fragment as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * <a [routerLink]="['/user/bob']" [queryParams]="{debug: true}" fragment="education">
 *   link to user component
 * </a>
 * ```
 * RouterLink will use these to generate this link: `/user/bob#education?debug=true`.
 *
 * (Deprecated in v4.0.0 use `queryParamsHandling` instead) You can also tell the
 * directive to preserve the current query params and fragment:
 *
 * ```
 * <a [routerLink]="['/user/bob']" preserveQueryParams preserveFragment>
 *   link to user component
 * </a>
 * ```
 *
 * You can tell the directive to how to handle queryParams, available options are:
 *  - `'merge'`: merge the queryParams into the current queryParams
 *  - `'preserve'`: preserve the current queryParams
 *  - default/`''`: use the queryParams only
 *
 * Same options for {\@link NavigationExtras#queryParamsHandling
 * NavigationExtras#queryParamsHandling}.
 *
 * ```
 * <a [routerLink]="['/user/bob']" [queryParams]="{debug: true}" queryParamsHandling="merge">
 *   link to user component
 * </a>
 * ```
 *
 * The router link directive always treats the provided input as a delta to the current url.
 *
 * For instance, if the current url is `/user/(box//aux:team)`.
 *
 * Then the following link `<a [routerLink]="['/user/jim']">Jim</a>` will generate the link
 * `/user/(jim//aux:team)`.

 * \@whatItDoes Lets you add a CSS class to an element when the link's route becomes active.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * ```
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive="active-link">Bob</a>
 * ```
 *
 * \@description
 *
 * The RouterLinkActive directive lets you add a CSS class to an element when the link's route
 * becomes active.
 *
 * Consider the following example:
 *
 * ```
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive="active-link">Bob</a>
 * ```
 *
 * When the url is either '/user' or '/user/bob', the active-link class will
 * be added to the `a` tag. If the url changes, the class will be removed.
 *
 * You can set more than one class, as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive="class1 class2">Bob</a>
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" [routerLinkActive]="['class1', 'class2']">Bob</a>
 * ```
 *
 * You can configure RouterLinkActive by passing `exact: true`. This will add the classes
 * only when the url matches the link exactly.
 *
 * ```
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive="active-link" [routerLinkActiveOptions]="{exact:
 * true}">Bob</a>
 * ```
 *
 * You can assign the RouterLinkActive instance to a template variable and directly check
 * the `isActive` status.
 * ```
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive #rla="routerLinkActive">
 *   Bob {{ rla.isActive ? '(already open)' : ''}}
 * </a>
 * ```
 *
 * Finally, you can apply the RouterLinkActive directive to an ancestor of a RouterLink.
 *
 * ```
 * <div routerLinkActive="active-link" [routerLinkActiveOptions]="{exact: true}">
 *   <a routerLink="/user/jim">Jim</a>
 *   <a routerLink="/user/bob">Bob</a>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * This will set the active-link class on the div tag if the url is either '/user/jim' or
 * '/user/bob'.

 *
 * RouterModule can be imported multiple times: once per lazily-loaded bundle.
 * Since the router deals with a global shared resource--location, we cannot have
 * more than one router service active.
 *
 * That is why there are two ways to create the module: `RouterModule.forRoot` and
 * `RouterModule.forChild`.
 *
 * * `forRoot` creates a module that contains all the directives, the given routes, and the router
 *   service itself.
 * * `forChild` creates a module that contains all the directives and the given routes, but does not
 *   include the router service.
 *
 * When registered at the root, the module should be used as follows
 *
 * ```
 * \@NgModule({
 *   imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(ROUTES)]
 * })
 * class MyNgModule {}
 * ```
 *
 * For submodules and lazy loaded submodules the module should be used as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * \@NgModule({
 *   imports: [RouterModule.forChild(ROUTES)]
 * })
 * class MyNgModule {}
 * ```
 *
 * \@description
 *
 * Managing state transitions is one of the hardest parts of building applications. This is
 * especially true on the web, where you also need to ensure that the state is reflected in the URL.
 * In addition, we often want to split applications into multiple bundles and load them on demand.
 * Doing this transparently is not trivial.
 *
 * The Angular router solves these problems. Using the router, you can declaratively specify
 * application states, manage state transitions while taking care of the URL, and load bundles on
 * demand.
 *
 * [Read this developer guide](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/router.html) to get an
 * overview of how the router should be used.

     * Invokes an execution of an Observable and registers Observer handlers for notifications it will emit.
     *
     * <span class="informal">Use it when you have all these Observables, but still nothing is happening.</span>
     *
     * `subscribe` is not a regular operator, but a method that calls Observable's internal `subscribe` function. It
     * might be for example a function that you passed to a {@link create} static factory, but most of the time it is
     * a library implementation, which defines what and when will be emitted by an Observable. This means that calling
     * `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often
     * thought.
     *
     * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values
     * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two
     * following ways.
     *
     * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods
     * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create
     * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do
     * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also
     * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't
     * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, that if `error` method is not provided, all errors will
     * be left uncaught.
     *
     * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.
     * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where first function is equivalent
     * of a `next` method, second of an `error` method and third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,
     * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,
     * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes
     * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.
     *
     * Whatever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.
     * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop work that an Observable does and will clean
     * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback
     * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.
     *
     * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.
     * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called. For example {@link of}
     * by default emits all its values synchronously. Always check documentation for how given Observable
     * will behave when subscribed and if its default behavior can be modified with a {@link Scheduler}.
     *
     * @example <caption>Subscribe with an Observer</caption>
     * const sumObserver = {
     *   sum: 0,
     *   next(value) {
     *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);
     *     this.sum = this.sum + value;
     *   },
     *   error() { // We actually could just remove this method,
     *   },        // since we do not really care about errors right now.
     *   complete() {
     *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + this.sum);
     *   }
     * };
     *
     * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3) // Synchronously emits 1, 2, 3 and then completes.
     * .subscribe(sumObserver);
     *
     * // Logs:
     * // "Adding: 1"
     * // "Adding: 2"
     * // "Adding: 3"
     * // "Sum equals: 6"
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Subscribe with functions</caption>
     * let sum = 0;
     *
     * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3)
     * .subscribe(
     *   function(value) {

     * Joins last values emitted by passed Observables.

     *
     * <img src="./img/forkJoin.png" width="100%">
     *
     * `forkJoin` is an operator that takes any number of Observables which can be passed either as an array
     * or directly as arguments. If no input Observables are provided, resulting stream will complete
     * immediately.
     *
     * `forkJoin` will wait for all passed Observables to complete and then it will emit an array with last
     * values from corresponding Observables. So if you pass `n` Observables to the operator, resulting
     * array will have `n` values, where first value is the last thing emitted by the first Observable,
     * second value is the last thing emitted by the second Observable and so on. That means `forkJoin` will
     * not emit more than once and it will complete after that. If you need to emit combined values not only
     * at the end of lifecycle of passed Observables, but also throughout it, try out {@link combineLatest}
     * or {@link zip} instead.
     *
     * In order for resulting array to have the same length as the number of input Observables, whenever any of
     * that Observables completes without emitting any value, `forkJoin` will complete at that moment as well
     * and it will not emit anything either, even if it already has some last values from other Observables.
     * Conversely, if there is an Observable that never completes, `forkJoin` will never complete as well,
     * unless at any point some other Observable completes without emitting value, which brings us back to
     * the previous case. Overall, in order for `forkJoin` to emit a value, all Observables passed as arguments
     * have to emit something at least once and complete.
     *
     * If any input Observable errors at some point, `forkJoin` will error as well and all other Observables
     * will be immediately unsubscribed.
     *
     * Optionally `forkJoin` accepts project function, that will be called with values which normally
     * would land in emitted array. Whatever is returned by project function, will appear in output
     * Observable instead. This means that default project can be thought of as a function that takes
     * all its arguments and puts them into an array. Note that project function will be called only
     * when output Observable is supposed to emit a result.
     *
     * @example <caption>Use forkJoin with operator emitting immediately</caption>
     * const observable = Rx.Observable.forkJoin(
     *   Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3, 4),
     *   Rx.Observable.of(5, 6, 7, 8)
     * );
     * observable.subscribe(
     *   value => console.log(value),
     *   err => {},
     *   () => console.log('This is how it ends!')
     * );
     *
     * // Logs:
     * // [4, 8]
     * // "This is how it ends!"
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Use forkJoin with operator emitting after some time</caption>
     * const observable = Rx.Observable.forkJoin(
     *   Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(3), // emit 0, 1, 2 every second and complete
     *   Rx.Observable.interval(500).take(4) // emit 0, 1, 2, 3 every half a second and complete
     * );

     *   value => console.log(value),

     * Creates an Observable that emits events of a specific type coming from the
     * given event target.
     *
     * <span class="informal">Creates an Observable from DOM events, or Node.js
     * EventEmitter events or others.</span>
     *
     * <img src="./img/fromEvent.png" width="100%">
     *
     * `fromEvent` accepts as a first argument event target, which is an object with methods
     * for registering event handler functions. As a second argument it takes string that indicates
     * type of event we want to listen for. `fromEvent` supports selected types of event targets,
     * which are described in detail below. If your event target does not match any of the ones listed,
     * you should use {@link fromEventPattern}, which can be used on arbitrary APIs.
     * When it comes to APIs supported by `fromEvent`, their methods for adding and removing event
     * handler functions have different names, but they all accept a string describing event type
     * and function itself, which will be called whenever said event happens.
     *
     * Every time resulting Observable is subscribed, event handler function will be registered
     * to event target on given event type. When that event fires, value
     * passed as a first argument to registered function will be emitted by output Observable.
     * When Observable is unsubscribed, function will be unregistered from event target.
     *
     * Note that if event target calls registered function with more than one argument, second
     * and following arguments will not appear in resulting stream. In order to get access to them,
     * you can pass to `fromEvent` optional project function, which will be called with all arguments
     * passed to event handler. Output Observable will then emit value returned by project function,
     * instead of the usual value.
     *
     * Remember that event targets listed below are checked via duck typing. It means that
     * no matter what kind of object you have and no matter what environment you work in,
     * you can safely use `fromEvent` on that object if it exposes described methods (provided
     * of course they behave as was described above). So for example if Node.js library exposes
     * event target which has the same method names as DOM EventTarget, `fromEvent` is still
     * a good choice.
     *
     * If the API you use is more callback then event handler oriented (subscribed
     * callback function fires only once and thus there is no need to manually
     * unregister it), you should use {@link bindCallback} or {@link bindNodeCallback}
     * instead.
     *
     * `fromEvent` supports following types of event targets:
     *
     * **DOM EventTarget**
     *
     * This is an object with `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` methods.
     *
     * In the browser, `addEventListener` accepts - apart from event type string and event
     * handler function arguments - optional third parameter, which is either an object or boolean,
     * both used for additional configuration how and when passed function will be called. When
     * `fromEvent` is used with event target of that type, you can provide this values
     * as third parameter as well.
     *
     * **Node.js EventEmitter**
     *
     * An object with `addListener` and `removeListener` methods.
     *
     * **JQuery-style event target**
     *
     * An object with `on` and `off` methods
     *
     * **DOM NodeList**
     *
     * List of DOM Nodes, returned for example by `document.querySelectorAll` or `Node.childNodes`.
     *
     * Although this collection is not event target in itself, `fromEvent` will iterate over all Nodes
     * it contains and install event handler function in every of them. When returned Observable
     * is unsubscribed, function will be removed from all Nodes.
     *
     * **DOM HtmlCollection**
     *
     * Just as in case of NodeList it is a collection of DOM nodes. Here as well event handler function is
     * installed and removed in each of elements.
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Emits clicks happening on the DOM document</caption>
     * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');
     * clicks.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
     *
     * // Results in:
     * // MouseEvent object logged to console every time a click
     * // occurs on the document.
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Use addEventListener with capture option</caption>
     * var clicksInDocument = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click', true); // note optional configuration parameter
     *                                                                          // which will be passed to addEventListener
     * var clicksInDiv = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(someDivInDocument, 'click');
     *
     * clicksInDocument.subscribe(() => console.log('document'));
     * clicksInDiv.subscribe(() => console.log('div'));
     *
     * // By default events bubble UP in DOM tree, so normally
     * // when we would click on div in document
     * // "div" would be logged first and then "document".
     * // Since we specified optional `capture` option, document
     * // will catch event when it goes DOWN DOM tree, so console
     * // will log "document" and then "div".

 * Combines multiple Observables to create an Observable whose values are

 * <span class="informal">Whenever any input Observable emits a value, it
 * computes a formula using the latest values from all the inputs, then emits
 * the output of that formula.</span>
 *
 * <img src="./img/combineLatest.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `combineLatest` combines the values from all the Observables passed as
 * arguments. This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,
 * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent
 * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,
 * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order
 * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable
 * on the first place and so on).
 *
 * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables
 * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of
 * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables
 * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that
 * completes immediately.
 *
 * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will
 * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,
 * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits
 * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last
 * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but
 * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without
 * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from
 * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does
 * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit
 * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some
 * value.
 *
 * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables
 * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined
 * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of
 * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case
 * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last
 * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`
 * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.
 *
 * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes
 * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.
 * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable
 * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array
 * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined
 * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Combine two timer Observables</caption>
 * const firstTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now
 * const secondTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now
 * const combinedTimers = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);
 * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));
 * // Logs
 * // [0, 0] after 0.5s
 * // [1, 0] after 1s
 * // [1, 1] after 1.5s
 * // [2, 1] after 2s
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Combine an array of Observables</caption>
 * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(
 *   n => Rx.Observable.of(n).delay(n * 1000).startWith(0) // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds
 * );
 * const combined = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(observables);
 * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));
 * // Logs
 * // [0, 0, 0] immediately
 * // [1, 0, 0] after 1s
 * // [1, 5, 0] after 5s
 * // [1, 5, 10] after 10s

 * <span class="informal">Concatenates multiple Observables together by
 * sequentially emitting their values, one Observable after the other.</span>
 *
 * <img src="./img/concat.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `concat` joins multiple Observables together, by subscribing to them one at a time and
 * merging their results into the output Observable. You can pass either an array of
 * Observables, or put them directly as arguments. Passing an empty array will result
 * in Observable that completes immediately.
 *
 * `concat` will subscribe to first input Observable and emit all its values, without
 * changing or affecting them in any way. When that Observable completes, it will
 * subscribe to then next Observable passed and, again, emit its values. This will be
 * repeated, until the operator runs out of Observables. When last input Observable completes,
 * `concat` will complete as well. At any given moment only one Observable passed to operator
 * emits values. If you would like to emit values from passed Observables concurrently, check out
 * {@link merge} instead, especially with optional `concurrent` parameter. As a matter of fact,
 * `concat` is an equivalent of `merge` operator with `concurrent` parameter set to `1`.
 *
 * Note that if some input Observable never completes, `concat` will also never complete
 * and Observables following the one that did not complete will never be subscribed. On the other
 * hand, if some Observable simply completes immediately after it is subscribed, it will be
 * invisible for `concat`, which will just move on to the next Observable.
 *
 * If any Observable in chain errors, instead of passing control to the next Observable,
 * `concat` will error immediately as well. Observables that would be subscribed after
 * the one that emitted error, never will.
 *
 * If you pass to `concat` the same Observable many times, its stream of values
 * will be "replayed" on every subscription, which means you can repeat given Observable
 * as many times as you like. If passing the same Observable to `concat` 1000 times becomes tedious,
 * you can always use {@link repeat}.
 *
 * @example <caption>Concatenate a timer counting from 0 to 3 with a synchronous sequence from 1 to 10</caption>
 * var timer = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(4);
 * var sequence = Rx.Observable.range(1, 10);

 * var timer1 = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(10);
 * var timer2 = Rx.Observable.interval(2000).take(6);
 * var timer3 = Rx.Observable.interval(500).take(10);
 * var result = Rx.Observable.concat([timer1, timer2, timer3]); // note that array is passed
 * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 *
 * // results in the following:
 * // (Prints to console sequentially)
 * // -1000ms-> 0 -1000ms-> 1 -1000ms-> ... 9
 * // -2000ms-> 0 -2000ms-> 1 -2000ms-> ... 5
 * // -500ms-> 0 -500ms-> 1 -500ms-> ... 9

/**
 *
 * Re-emits all notifications from source Observable with specified scheduler.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Ensure a specific scheduler is used, from outside of an Observable.</span>
 *
 * `observeOn` is an operator that accepts a scheduler as a first parameter, which will be used to reschedule
 * notifications emitted by the source Observable. It might be useful, if you do not have control over
 * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.
 *
 * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,
 * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal
 * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits
 * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.
 * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split
 * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source
 * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a
 * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.
 *
 * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications
 * will be emitted. The main difference between {@link delay} operator and `observeOn` is that `observeOn`
 * will delay all notifications - including error notifications - while `delay` will pass through error
 * from source Observable immediately when it is emitted. In general it is highly recommended to use `delay` operator
 * for any kind of delaying of values in the stream, while using `observeOn` to specify which scheduler should be used
 * for notification emissions in general.
 *
 * @example <caption>Ensure values in subscribe are called just before browser repaint.</caption>
 * const intervals = Rx.Observable.interval(10); // Intervals are scheduled
 *                                               // with async scheduler by default...
 *
 * intervals
 * .observeOn(Rx.Scheduler.animationFrame)       // ...but we will observe on animationFrame
 * .subscribe(val => {                           // scheduler to ensure smooth animation.
 *   someDiv.style.height = val + 'px';
 * });
 *
 * @see {@link delay}
 *
 * @param {IScheduler} scheduler Scheduler that will be used to reschedule notifications from source Observable.
 * @param {number} [delay] Number of milliseconds that states with what delay every notification should be rescheduled.
